##Timed Quiz 

This project is based on a tutorial found on Treehouse at http://teamtreehouse.com/library/dates-and-times-in-python

The initial commit was what I learned in the tutorial. 

Currently it randomly creates a comination of ten addition or multiplication questions,
reports how many questions were correct out of 10,
and how long it took to answer them all.

I'll be working on the following enhancements to the program:


1. Change so it takes a number of questions to generate.

2. Make sure the user can specify the range of numbers to practice.

3. Add in some further stats that tell you how long it took to answer each question.

4. Add subtraction questions.

5. Let the user choose which operator they want to practice.

I'm also experimenting with using a todo file to track my changes as I work on the program.
