Purpose:

To play around with times 
To understand OO programing better
To practice using git and github to manage a project

Some things to try for the quiz:
1. Change so it takes a number of questions to generate
2. Make sure the user can specify the range they want the numbers to come from
3. Add in some further stats that tell you how long it took to answer each question.
4. Add subtraction questions
5. Allow the user to practice specific operators

FINISHED TASKS:
1. Solved scoring bug
2. Added subtraction
3. Allow user to determine number of qustions

-noticed it's scoring everything out of 0. 
-fix this bug!
-discovered the problem:
	- I was using input instead of raw_input
	- to get answers from the user.
	- The original code was written for Python 3.x, but now using 2.x
	- Once I changed it to raw_input, worked like a charm. 

* I wonder if it's possible to test for the version of Python,
then use the correct function: input if it's 3.x and raw_input if 3.x. 

-----
-decided to work on adding Subtraction questions. 
-okay it was easier than I thought.
-done.

----

-working on letting the user pick the number of questions
thoughts:
-can I do it in the __init__?  CAN, but better to do it outside the class, 
before calling the Quiz().
-should I make it a separate method or not? NO
-DONE.

----

-working on further stats for timing each answer, rather than the whole quiz
-DONE
